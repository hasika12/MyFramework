========================== MAVEN INFO =======================
The Surefire Plugin is used during the test phase of the build lifecycle to execute the unit tests of an application. 
It generates reports in two different file formats:

Plain text files (*.txt)
XML files (*.xml)
By default, these files are generated in ${basedir}/target/surefire-reports/TEST-*.xml.

Run as, Maven clean will delete the target folder in our local git location(C:\Users\Sai\git\MyFramework\com.automation.framework\target)
target folder will contain previous reports, jars etc...

Run as, Maven install will do 2 things
1) it will check whether all the dependencies are present in local or not if present it will skip, else it will download from web
2) it will build the complete project and will generate the jar file and it will run our test as well

Run as, Maven build will ask to specify goals. specify as clean install.
and for adding the parameters click on add and the browser parameter

Even if single test fails, it will be shown as build failed

few exceptions observed while running as Maven install
1) No complier is provided please consider adding JDK, then goto--> click on window> Preference> point to JDK


Inorder to run the scripts from cmd launch cmd and navigate to the path where the project is located
we should give the path till pom.xml cd C:\Users\Sai\git\MyFramework\com.automation.framework
now when we say mvn clean here like C:\Users\Sai\git\MyFramework\com.automation.framework> mvn clean
it will delete the target folder

when we say mvn install here like C:\Users\Sai\git\MyFramework\com.automation.framework> mvn install

when we say mvn install it will (w.r.to this framework) becoz we need to pass parameters here as
mvn install -Dbrowser=Chrome -DurlToBeTested=https://ui.cogmento.com/ -DxmlFiles=regression.xml
